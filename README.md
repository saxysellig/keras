## Guiding principles

[...]

- __Modularity.__ A model is understood as a sequence or a graph of standalone, fully-configurable modules that can be plugged together with as little restrictions as possible. In particular, neural layers, cost functions, optimizers, initialization schemes, activation functions, regularization schemes are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new models.


## Getting started: 30 seconds to Keras

The core data structure of Keras is a __model__, a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the [`Sequential`](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide) model, a linear stack of layers. For more complex architectures, you should use the [Keras functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide), which allows to build arbitrary graphs of layers.

Here is the `Sequential` model:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential

model = Sequential()
```

Stacking layers is as easy as `.add()`:

```python
from keras.layers import Dense

model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
```

Once your model looks good, configure its learning process with `.compile()`:

```python
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='sgd',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

If you need to, you can further configure your optimizer. A core principle of Keras is to make things reasonably simple, while allowing the user to be fully in control when they need to (the ultimate control being the easy extensibility of the source code).
```python
model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,
              optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True))
```

You can now iterate on your training data in batches:

```python
# x_train and y_train are Numpy arrays --just like in the Scikit-Learn API.
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
```

Alternatively, you can feed batches to your model manually:

```python
model.train_on_batch(x_batch, y_batch)
```

Evaluate your performance in one line:

```python
loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)
```

Or generate predictions on new data:

```python
classes = model.predict(x_test, batch_size=128)
```

Building a question answering system, an image classification model, a Neural Turing Machine, or any other model is just as fast. The ideas behind deep learning are simple, so why should their implementation be painful?
